Moonlight Cafe

Concept:
Moonlight Café is a fictional coffee shop website inspired by the calm and cozy atmosphere of late-night cafés. 
The design blends dark tones with warm golden highlights to evoke the soft glow of moonlight and candlelight.

Design Choices:
The layout is minimal yet immersive, featuring a hero section with a background image and smooth color overlay. 
Typography uses the Poppins font for readability and modern aesthetics. Subtle hover effects and transitions bring the menu items and buttons to life, 
creating a warm and interactive browsing experience. The entire website is responsive and cleanly structured in HTML and CSS, 
demonstrating design focus over complex functionality.
